## Downloading dataset from Kaggle
## ================================

# Login to Kaggle using Lynx
#       Note: Make sure the file 'lynx.cfg' is in the current directory

lynx -cfg=lynx.cfg www.kaggle.com

# ... Browse and login. (Be sure to check-mark 'Remember me')
# ... Exit from the text-based browser. A file 'lynx_cookies.file' should be created (see lynx.cfg file)

# Download the dataset file:
wget -c --load-cookies=lynx_cookies.file <URL to the dataset download>

#  NOTE: If this is the first time you've downloaded a file from a competition,
#          you will be prompted to accept terms and condition (TOC) first before
#          you can proceed with the download. If this happens, go to the download
#          page using a regular brower, click one of the download items, and 
#          accept the TOC. You can then come back here and proceed with the wget download.

## Mounting EBS Volume
## ===============================

# - In amazon console, attach the volume to the instance
# - SSH to the instance


# ec2
# * Viewing available disk devices
# --------------------------------
lsblk

# * Viewing mounted devices
# --------------------------------
df -h

# * Checking if device has data (has file system)
# --------------------------------
sudo file -s /dev/xvdf      # /dev/xvdf is the device name

#   If device has no file system, it should output:
#       /dev/xvdf: data
#
#   If device has file system, it should output similar to:
#       /dev/xvdf: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, UUID=1701d228-e1bd-4094-a14c-8c64d6819362 (needs journal recovery) (extents) (large files) (huge files)


# * Creating file system for blank devices
# --------------------------------
#       NOTE: Only use this on blank devices
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf     # /dev/xvdf is the device_name


# Mounting device
# --------------------------------

# * Create a directory to where to mount
sudo mkdir ~/ml-data

# * Mount device
sudo mount /dev/xvdf ~/ml-data


# * Check permisions, and change if needed
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu ~/ml-data
