\section{Result}

Some images from validation and test set that were not used in training were evaluated. It can be seen that the model performs well on most images. However, there are also cases where it misses. The area highlighted in cyan is the ground truth while the area outlined in yellow is the prediction produced by the model (See Figure \ref{fig:result}).
