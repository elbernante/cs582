\section{Conclusion}

There is no doubt the role of deep learning in advancing the technologies used in the modern medical industry is getting more significant over the years. Ultrasound imaging is only one of the many medical applications. This project is only a small step, but it shows a great potential to what it can accomplish.

Given that the training data has a good portion of inaccuracies, the predictions of the model is surprisingly good that it can point the location of nerve structures, or the absence thereof. The predicted area of the image shows the general location of the brachial plexus, very similar to the human annotators.

It is interesting to note that the machine learning model was able to identify nerve structures after training within hours, while an untrained person would not be able to figure out the pattern from the same set of images.

Significant improvement on inference time would be very useful to make the model run on a real time application in video input, or run natively in less powerful devices such as on mobile platform.
