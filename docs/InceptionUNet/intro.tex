\section{Introduction}
Surgery oftentimes involves post-surgical pain. Managing pain involves the use of narcotics which have several unwanted side effects; under or overdosing respiratory side effects and sedation.

One way to manage pain with less dependency on narcotics is through the use of indwelling catheters that deliver anesthetic. Pain management catheters block or mitigate the pain at the source. These catheters are inserted in the area around the nerves that carries sensation from the surgical site. It is therefore imperative to accurately identify nerve structures in order to effectively insert the catheters.

The goal of this project is to identify a collection of nerve structures called the Brachial Plexus (BP) . Given an ultrasound image, highlight or annotate the area in the image where the BP is located.

We will apply deep learning in computer vision to recognize the BPs in ultrasound images. In doing so, the following tasks will be involved:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify a collection of nerve structures called the Brachial Plexus.
  \item Given an ultrasound image, annotate the area in the image where BP is present
  \item Design a deep neural network to accomplish the task.
\end{enumerate}
The generated trained model can be useful in several ways. For example, it can be integrated with ultrasound apparatus to automatically show the area of interest.
