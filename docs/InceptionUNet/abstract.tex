We develop an algorithm that can detect a collection of nerve structures called the Brachial Plexus (BP) \cite{wiki:Brachial_plexus}.
Our algorithm, Inception U-Net, is a deep convolutional neural network trained on ultrasound images from \cite{kaggle:ultrasound-nerve-segmentation}. The images were manually annotated by humans who were experts. We used a modified U-Net \cite{2015arXiv150504597R} architecture, and replaced its VGG-like \cite{2014arXiv1409.1556S} layers with Inception Modules \cite{2015arXiv151200567S}. We find that the Inception Modules made the model deeper and significantly reduced the number of parameters. We also found that, although the number of parameters is only a fraction of the standard U-Net, it had better performance in terms of defined metrics. Our algorithm was also able to annotate the images where the human annotators could not.
